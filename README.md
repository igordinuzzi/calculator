## Introduction
The Basic Scientific Calculator is a web-based tool designed to assist users in performing a variety of mathematical calculations. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for quick and accurate results.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The calculator provides an easy-to-use interface suitable for users of all levels.
- **Memory Functions**: Store and recall values using memory buttons.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a number.
- **Exponentiation**: Compute the power of a number.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is responsive and works on various devices.

## Usage
1. **Numeric Input**: Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
2. **Decimal Point**: Use the dot (.) button for decimal numbers.
3. **Memory Functions**: Store and recall values using the Memory Recall (MR), Memory Clear (MC), Memory Add (M+), and Memory Subtract (M-) buttons.
4. **Arithmetic Operations**: Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
5. **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a number by entering the value and clicking the square root button (√).
6. **Exponentiation**: Compute the power of a number by entering the base, clicking the exponentiation button (^), and then entering the exponent.

## Memory Functions
- **Memory Recall (MR)**: Retrieves the value stored in memory and displays it.
- **Memory Clear (MC)**: Clears the memory.
- **Memory Add (M+)**: Adds the current value to the value stored in memory.
- **Memory Subtract (M-)**: Subtracts the current value from the value stored in memory.

## Mathematical Operations
- **Addition (+)**: Adds the current value to the previous value.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the current value from the previous value.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies the current value by the previous value.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the previous value by the current value (division by zero is not allowed).
- **Square Root (√)**: Calculates the square root of the current value (negative input not allowed).
- **Exponentiation (^)**: Computes the power of the current value to the exponent.
